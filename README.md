this project includes advance object detection using yolo and vgg net
and other technologies .
it will include lane detection deviation 
future car prediction and analysis of vehicle cut in 
this system will give a warning before 5 seconds since eye activity nearly takes 2 seconds
further to improve the future path take by car implementation of parabolic equation and advance maths technique to get deviation 
we get more accurate result .
