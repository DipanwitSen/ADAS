Abstract
This Flask web application uses deep learning models for vehicle classification and detection. 
Users can upload an image to classify the vehicle into Auto, Bus, Tempo, Tractor, or Truck categories. 
The app also streams live video from a camera, detects objects using YOLO, and calculates object speed and time to collision. 
The necessary libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, TensorFlow Keras, and YOLO, are imported for tasks like numerical computations, data manipulation, computer vision, deep learning, and object detection. 
Data is loaded from an image directory, and DataFrames are prepared for each vehicle class. 
Neural network models are built and trained using the Sequential API with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. 
The Flask app instance is created, and the trained classification model and YOLO model are loaded for object detection.
Routes are defined for image classification, live video streaming, and root access. Functions for streaming video, calculating collision time, and classifying images are implemented. 
Templates are rendered for displaying the web interface.

Optimizers:

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Updates model parameters based on the gradient of the loss function.
Momentum: Adds a momentum term to SGD to help escape local minima.
Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG): A variant of SGD with a different momentum update rule.
Adagrad: Adaptive learning rate optimizer that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter.
Adadelta: Adaptive learning rate optimizer that adapts the learning rate based on the gradient.
RMSprop: Adaptive learning rate optimizer that divides the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients.
Adam: Adaptive learning rate optimizer that combines the benefits of Adagrad and RMSprop.
Adamax: A variant of Adam that uses the infinity norm instead of the L2 norm.
Nadam: A variant of Adam that incorporates Nesterov momentum.
Quasi-Hyperbolic Momentum (QHM): A variant of SGD with a quasi-hyperbolic momentum update rule.

Compilers:

TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.
PyTorch: An open-source machine learning framework developed by Facebook.
Keras: A high-level neural networks API that can run on top of TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Theano.
CNTK: A deep learning framework developed by Microsoft Research.
MXNet: An open-source deep learning framework developed by Amazon.

Activation Functions:

Sigmoid: Maps the input to a value between 0 and 1.
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): Maps all negative values to 0 and all positive values to the same value.
Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent): Maps the input to a value between -1 and 1.
Softmax: Maps the input to a probability distribution over multiple classes.
Leaky ReLU: A variant of ReLU that allows a small fraction of the input to pass through.
Swish: A self-gated activation function that can be used as a drop-in replacement for ReLU.
GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit): A activation function that is similar to ReLU but with a smoother curve.

Layers:

Dense (Fully Connected) Layer: A layer where every input is connected to every output.
Convolutional Layer: A layer that applies a convolution operation to the input data.
Pooling Layer: A layer that downsamples the input data to reduce spatial dimensions.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Layer: A layer that processes sequential data and maintains a hidden state.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Layer: A variant of RNN that uses memory cells to store information.
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Layer: A variant of RNN that uses gates to control the flow of information.
Batch Normalization Layer: A layer that normalizes the input data to reduce internal covariate shift.
Dropout Layer: A layer that randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting.
Flatten Layer: A layer that flattens the input data into a 1D array.
Reshape Layer: A layer that reshapes the input data into a specific shape.
