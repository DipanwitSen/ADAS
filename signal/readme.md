Validation Transforms (validation_transforms):
Resizes images to a fixed size and converts to tensor.
Train-Validation Split:
Splits the dataset (dataset) into training (train_set) and validation (validation_set) sets using train_test_split function.

DataLoaders:

Implements forward method for forward propagation.
Includes methods for computing training and validation metrics (training_metrics, validation_metrics).
Compiles the model (compile method) with training data, validation data, epochs, loss function, optimizer, and learning rate scheduler.
Training Loop:

Iteratively trains the model (compile method) over specified epochs.
Uses Adam optimizer, CrossEntropyLoss loss function, and a learning rate scheduler (LinearLR).
Displays training progress using tqdm for visual feedback on loss, accuracy, and learning rate.
Computes and stores metrics (training accuracy, validation accuracy, training loss, validation loss) in metrics_dict.
Testing (testdata):

Creates a test dataset (testdata) with transformations similar to validation.
Initializes a DataLoader (test_dataloader) for batched testing data.
Evaluates the model's performance on the test data, computes predictions (y_pred), and compares them with ground truth labels (y_true).
Uses accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics to calculate and display the test accuracy.
